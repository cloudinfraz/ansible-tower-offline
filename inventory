# Database Settings
# =================

# Set pg_hostname if you have an external postgres server, otherwise
# a new postgres service will be created
# pg_hostname=postgresql

# If using an external database, provide your existing credentials.
# If you choose to use the provided containerized Postgres depolyment, these

# openshift_skip_tls_verify=false
# openshift_project=tower

# openshift_password=password
# If you don't want to hardcode a password here, just do:
# ./setup_openshift.sh -e openshift_token=$TOKEN

# Skip this section if you BYO database. This is only used when you want the
# installer to deploy a containerized Postgres deployment inside of your
# OpenShift cluster. This is only recommended if you have experience storing and
# managing persistent data in containerized environments.

# Name of a PVC you've already provisioned for database:
# openshift_pg_pvc_name=postgresql
